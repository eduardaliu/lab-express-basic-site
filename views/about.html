    <h1>ABOUT</h1> 
    <div>Marc Johns creates whimsical drawings filled with dry wit and humour. Whether it’s a man with branches growing
        out of his head that need pruning, or a pipe that’s trying to quit smoking, his creations are simply, sparsely
        drawn, yet speak volumes with just a few strokes of the pen. He's been drawing since he was tiny. He's not tiny
        anymore, but he's not exactly big either. </div>
